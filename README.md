# Naive Bayes Classifier

In this project, I implemented the Naive Bayes algorithm for a spam detection problem. The supervised algorithm predicts the probability of an email being in the 'spam' or 'ham' class by analyzing the words in the email based on the Bayes' Theorem. I then used log probabilites to resolve the underflow problem and improve the prediction accuracy significantly.
